# appointment-application

Application is developed using java,it uses the GUI to facilitate a good interface. Hardly interact with the terminal.

The mini booking application is operated by one person who is able to book and view bookings made.
The application saves bookings to a text file and the file is used to avoid double booking. 
The application loops through the file. If the selected date and slot is found in the text file, it then tells the user that the slot has been booked. This forces them to change the slot or date if the entire day was booked.
