# appointment-application

Application is developed using java,it uses the GUI to facilitate a good interface. Hardly interact with the terminal.

The application is operated by one person who is able to book and also see the people who have booked.
It is a mini booking application, which allows a person to book and also let them see the bookings which have been made.
The application saves bookings to a text file and the file is used to avoid double booking. 
The application loops through the file. If the selected date and slot is found in the text file, it then tells the user that the slot has been booked. This forces them to change the slot or date if the entire day was booked.
The application is made up of 2 section booking and view booking.
